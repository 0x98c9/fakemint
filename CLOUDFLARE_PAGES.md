# Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration for Next.js

This file configures Cloudflare Pages to build and deploy your Next.js app using @cloudflare/next-on-pages.

- **buildCommand**: Uses the next-on-pages adapter to build your Next.js app for Cloudflare Pages.
- **buildOutputDirectory**: Points to the static output directory generated by next-on-pages.
- **functionsDirectory**: Points to the serverless functions output directory.

You can now deploy your project to Cloudflare Pages. In the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, set the build command to:

```
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1
```

and the output directory to:

```
.vercel/output/static
```

If you see a compatibility flag error, enable the `nodejs_compat` flag in your Cloudflare Pages project settings (when available).
